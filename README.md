# bash.py

This is a little bash-inspired command line tool which I'm writing in python.

It's my first project with python, so I appreciate any help, ideas or improvements!


### Setup
Download and extract the repository. In your console, run
`python main.py`.
You should now see a bash-like command line.
For more information, you can just type `help` or `about`.
